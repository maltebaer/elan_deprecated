                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    ELAN was born out of the need to challenge existing power
                    dynamics and the traditional flow of knowledge that exists
                    in both the corporate world and the cultural zeitgeist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User adoption is often thought of as a challenge for
                    businesses to try to find product market fit. How do they do
                    it? They listen to their customers, but in the end what
                    dictates their decisions is a preexisting idea of who their
                    customer should be. We at ELAN don't believe in what
                    consumers should be or shouldn't be. We believe that
                    products and their messaging need to shift to fit this
                    newer, emerging world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we know that the mechanism for this dual
                    change has to come through exposure to diversity &
                    inclusion, giving something back to the community and
                    supporting the local scene.
                </p>
                <p>The unnegotiable.</p>
                <p>
                    The clients we work with embrace — or are open to embracing
                    — this changing world wholeheartedly.
